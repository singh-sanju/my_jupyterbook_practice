# Create your first Jupyter Book 2

Now it's your turn to get going creating content in a Jupyter Book.

There are some conditions to meet before you can get started:

- Programming and Git experience are not strictly necessary, but it does make things a bit easier.
- A free [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.
- A little bit of patience, it's a steep learning curve.

Optional:
- [Software](#software) to write your code in, such as Jupyter Lab or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (VSC).

If you are feeling confident and would rather start building a document from scratch using the CLI on your computer, you can look at [the advanced start](#advanced-start) option 🌶.

We provide instructions for building using the GitHub development IDE, as well as building locally. For the latter we assume knowledge about VSC, and the use of git.

Ready? Let's get started…
