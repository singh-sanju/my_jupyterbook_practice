# Introduction

This is the *Jupyter Book 2 Workshop Template,* designed to quickly and easily produce your own online interactive textbook as well as a high quality PDF enabled with Typst using [Jupyter Book 2](https://next.jupyterbook.org/) technology.

This template:
- provides a ready-to-use Jupyter Book 2 structure for creating an online book (i.e., website),
- includes a number of lessons to get started understanding key components of a book and how to edit it,
- includes a GitHub Action workflow to automatically build and deploy your book online,
- provides instructions for generating a high quality PDF with Typst using a ready-to-go template, then deploy it online automatically using GitHub Actions.


Hence, the template allows you to engage with JB2 (and the underlying software MyST) _without installing any software on your own computer._ You only need a web browser and a GitHub account (we provide details on how to work locally on your own computer). For those who are comfortable installing software locally (i.e., with a CLI) and/or do not want to use the template book structure, use the [Advanced Start](./advanced_start.md) instructions, denoted with red hot 🌶.

As this document serves both as a template _and_ a guide, it has the following structure:

1. A quick introduction to key Jupyter Book 2, MyST and Markdown concepts.
2. A tutorial with several steps to introduce you to editing and building your own book.
3. Additional resources, for example, [Advanced Start instructions](./advanced_start.md) and [Software](./software.md).

```{note}
The template and its content are not meant as a replacement of the documentation already available on the [Jupyter Book 2 website](https://next.jupyterbook.org/) and the [MyST website](https://mystmd.org/guide). It is designed to support new users of Jupyter Book 2 and MystMD, in particular for use in workshop settings where participants may not have time or ability to install the required software on a personal computer.

Once you start building JB2 books, it is likely you will get hooked!
For instance, try changing this cell in the browser and see its output!
